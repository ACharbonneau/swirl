text,"In a very broad sense of the term, a scientist is one who engages in a systematic method to acquire knowledge. More importantly, a scientist seeks to answer important questions or problems through careful observations and methods. These observations - collected from experiments, censuses, surveys, field notes, etc. - are known as DATA. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
text,"Once a question has been posed, or a problem identified, the next logical step is to attempt to answer the question. Unfortunately, without any additional information, it is very difficult to answer a question, or diagnose a problem. This is where data collection comes into play!

text,But how exactly does one collect useful data?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
text,"Remember, when conducting research, a scientist wants to answer a question, one that is usually targeted at a specific population.

text,"Unfortunately, it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to collect thorough data from an entire population. Not only can it be very time-consuming to do so, it may also  be an inefficient use of resources. Instead, scientists target a SAMPLE population. This sample population is selected in such a way that it is REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population in question. In mathematical terms, this sample population is called a subset of the target population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

figure,The 'midsize' bar has been highlighted green and is the most expensive on average. The 'small' bar has been highlighted blue and is the least expensive on average.,,,,,mod1_bargraph_add.R,addition,,,,,,,
question,"According to the bar graph, what is the average price for a 'large' car (in $1000s)?",range,,"22
26","Look at the highest value on the y-axis that the ""large"" bar reaches.",,,,,,,,,

text,"Up until now, every plot I have introduced has involved only one variable. But what if you are trying to analyze two variables? A SCATTER PLOT provides a comparative view of data for two numerical variables, with one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. This type of a plot is useful because it allows you to see whether two variables are related and to what degree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
figure,Here's an example of a scatter plot.,,,,,mod1_scatter.R,new,,,,,,,
question,"Of the three variables discussed previously: continuous, discrete, and categorical, which do you think would be most appropriate to use in a scatter plot?",multiple,"Continuous
Discrete
Categorical",Continuous,Think about which of the three variable types has an indefinite number of possible values.,,,,,,,,,
