<p>As you've already learned, <strong>swirl</strong> is a platform for learning statistics and R simultaneously and interactively. However, an educational platform is only as good as the content it delivers to students. Although we have contributed some content ourselves, <strong>swirl</strong> is designed in such a way that anyone can create his or her own content to be shared with students everywhere. Whether you are interested in creating a short module or an entire course, you'll find everything you need on this page.</p>

<p>We've tried to make content creation as simple as possible, so that you can focus on the message you wish to convey to students and not nit-picky technical details. The following video walks you through the process of creating a simple module from start to finish:</p>

<h1>The video will be right here!</h1>

In summary, here are the main steps in creating your own <strong>swirl</strong> content:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download both of the following templates (Excel spreadsheets)
		<ul>
			<li><a href="Module_Info_TEMPLATE.xlsx">Module_Info_TEMPLATE.xlsx (Stores information about content)</a></li>
			<li><a href="Module_TEMPLATE.xlsx">Module_TEMPLATE.xlsx (Stores actual content)</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Input module info into <strong>Module_Info_TEMPLATE.xlsx</strong> spreadsheet</li>
	<li>Input module content into <strong>Module_TEMPLATE.xlsx</strong> spreadsheet</li>
	<li>Rename both files (per instructions in video)</li>
	<li><a href="mailto:swirlboss@gmail.com">Send us</a> your completed spreadsheets so that we can add them to the next release of the <strong>swirl</strong> package!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any questions about using the <strong>swirl</strong> platform to share your knowledge with the world (or even just a few people), then please <a href="mailto:swirlboss@gmail.com">contact us</a> and we'll be happy to help.</p>
