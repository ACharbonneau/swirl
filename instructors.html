<p>As you've already learned, <strong>swirl</strong> is a platform for learning statistics and R simultaneously and interactively. However, an educational platform is only as good as the content it delivers to students. Although we have contributed some content ourselves, <strong>swirl</strong> is designed in such a way that anyone can create his or her own content to be shared with students everywhere. Whether you are interested in creating a short module or an entire course, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you will be provided detailed instructions for content creation on this page. In the meantime, if you'd like to use the <strong>swirl</strong> platform to share your knowledge with the world (or even just a few people) then please <a href="mailto:swirlboss@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>
